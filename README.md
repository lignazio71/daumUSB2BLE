# ergoFACE 2023
forked from https://github.com/weinzmi/daumUSB2BLE 

Identical to the original code but,
* modified daumUSB.js to be compatible with newer "serialport" version as I was not able to make v3.1.2 used in the original project working, and
* added a step-by-step guide from "empty micro sd-card" to "ZWIFT working" for people like me not very skilled with the raspberry pi world.

Many thanks @github/weinzmi for the idea and the working code

# Step by Step Setup Guide

## HARDWARE needed:
1. Raspberry PI zero W  (likely other models are also working) + micro usb supply + micro sd card

2. Ergometer DAUM 8008. Depending on how much rust is on it, it cost between 100 and 300â‚¬
3. RS-232 modified cable. You need,
   * 1x cheap rs 232 cable,
   * two break out plugs (one male ,one female),
   * resistor 4.7kOhm (to be used in the female break out plug),
   * see the connections [scheme](https://bikeboard.at/forum/topic/1564-schnittstellenkabel-rs-232-an-pc/#comment-2424750)
4. USB to RS232 (male) converter
5. USB-A to micro-USB converter to connect to the rasperry pi zero w

To set up the raspberry pi you do not need the bike. So I would first start with the Raspberry (1) and only when it is working properly move to points 2 to 5 and buy the bike.

Some models of the DAUM 8008 are supposed to work with a normal RS 232 cable, I would give first a try before modifying it.

## Setting up the Raspberry Pi
### Before starting
My Raspberry pi zero W was a bit unstable. I repeated the procedure below on a fresh SD card to check it. No errors but the bluetooth on the card was not working anymore. 
I inserted back the working SD card and the bluetooth was also not working. The next day I restarded from scratch the installation, and everything was ok.

Even if you arrive to the end of the installation procedure without errors it might not work and you need to repeat it ....

### Install Instructions
Use the [imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to prepare the micro SD card. I have selected:
* Operaing System: RASPBERRY PI OS (32-bit)
  * the UI is not really needed, but I used it to check if the PI was able to connect to a bluetooth mouse.
* In the settings define:
  * a name for the host e.g. "ergoface", 
  * the user name. This MUST be "pi".  Set a password you like to connect,
  * set up the WLAN to connect later on with SSH. (SSID and password)

Once the PI is up and running connect ssh to it. On a mac open Terminal and type:
```shell
ssh pi@ergoface.local
```

Enable the serial port
```shell
sudo raspi-config
```  
Go to point 3, then to serial interface.  Answer the first question witn NO and the second with YES.
Right arrow until "Finish", when you press enter the system will reboot.

Connect again ssh to the raspberry.

Set up the bluetooth according to bleno instructions:
```shell
sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
```
```shell
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth
```
```shell
sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```
```shell
sudo reboot
```
Connect again ssh to the raspberry.

Set up node.js. I have used version 10.24.1
```shell
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.24.1/node-v10.24.1-linux-armv6l.tar.gz
```
```shell
tar -xf node-v10.24.1-linux-armv6l.tar.gz
```
```shell
sudo mv node-v10.24.1-linux-armv6l /usr/local/node
```
```shell
cd /usr/bin
```
```shell
sudo ln -s /usr/local/node/bin/node node
```
```shell
sudo ln -s /usr/local/node/bin/npm npm
```
```shell
cd /home/pi
```

Downolad the program from GitHub (you might need to install git ...)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/lignazio71/daumUSB2BLE.git
```
Install all dependencies and the program
```shell
cd daumUSB2BLE/
```
```shell
source installPackages.sh 
```
It will take roughly 30 minutes to complete. It will install all the packages with the exact version that was working for me.

To try if it is working
```shell
sudo node server.js 
```

### Working/Not Working
I have tried and it was recognized by these apps
* Zwift
* MyWhoosh
* Whaoo RGT
* Trainer Day (but not controlling the power, just displaying Power/RPM/Speed)

I have tried wo success 
* to detect it with my Garmin Watch but it did not work
* Break Away for iOS



# ergoFACE
* forked from https://github.com/360manu/kettlerUSB2BLE
* adjusted to work with Daum ergobike 8008TRS

## the original project "ergoFACE concept"
* can be found here https://github.com/weinzmi/ergoFACE

## prerequisites
* RS232 to USB converter
* RS232 custom gender changer or "programing cable" like specified from DAUM
* raspberry pi zero w / 3B+ with BLE (Bluetooth low energy) onboard
* nodejs (10.xx.x LTS) installed https://nodejs.org/en/

## setup - Install on a rasperypi
* download the sources / dependencies listed in package.json
* have a look at bleno setup https://github.com/noble/bleno

```shell
npm install
```

it can take a while as bleno must be compiled from sources.

## launch
* if SIM mode is a feature you want to use, edit the parameters in config.yml to fit yours
```
simulation:
    maxGrade: 16 // maximum grade, higher than this, will be cut
    mRider: 78 // weight of you, the rider
    mBike: 9 // weight of your bike

gearbox: // this are the gear ratios used for each gear
    g1: 1.36
    g2: 1.48
    g3: 1.62
    g4: 1.79
    g5: 2.00
    g6: 2.17
    g7: 2.38
    g8: 2.63
    g9: 2.94
    g10: 3.33
    g11: 3.57
    g12: 3.85
    g13: 4.17
    g14: 4.55
```

## GIOPs for shifting gears
* if you want to use 2 external buttons for shifting gears, edit the parameters in config.yml to fit yours
```
gpio:
    geargpio: 1 // start gear for initializing
    ratio: 1 // how many gears are shifted with one push of a button
    minGear: 1 // lowest gear possible
    maxGear: 14 // highest gear possible; has to match gearbox
    debounceTimeout: 10
    shiftUpPin: 4 // GPIO pin for shift up
    shiftDownPin: 17 // GPIO pin for shift down
```

* go to installation directory and start node server from command line
```shell
sudo node server.js
```
### you can install the server as a service, to just plug the raspberry to a power source and ride on

* copy ergoFACE.service from lib\systemd\system to your local system (this is an example for Raspbian Stretch)
```shell
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/ergoFACE.service
```
* configure
```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable ergoFACE.service
```
* reboot
```shell
sudo reboot
```
* check status of service
```shell
sudo systemctl status ergoFACE.service
```

* plug the RS232 to USB converter in any USB port
* start your Daum ergobike 8008 TRS
* ergoFACE will lookup for the cockpit address and start receiving data
* start an app like ZWIFT and your Daum bike will appear as "DAUM Ergobike 8008 TRS" device with two services (power & FTMS)

## website / server
* start your browser and enter "pi-adress:3000" (try to get fixed IP address for you raspberry on your router before)
you can follow the ergoFACE activity on a this website.
It will display the current power, rpm, speed
the current gear and program your Daum is running and the socket messages.
This site is used to toggle between ERG and SIM mode and toggle between switching gears or just power
### you can use the server to:
* see current data from Daum Ergobike
* see power calculation (simulation), grade (slope), Cw (aerodynamic drag coefficient)
* see current program & gear
* stop / restart RS232 interface via server
* select gears
* select program
* toggle set Power / switch gears
* toggle socket messages - key / raw / error

## current features 0.6.4 BETA
### common
* advanced webserver with dashboard and log messages based on Bootstrap v4.1.3
* apps recognize BLE (Bluetooth low energy) GATT FTM (Fitness machine) and CPC (Cycling power and cadence) service
### in ZWIFT
* ERG mode is fully implemented (FTMS control point), can be switched in workouts via ZWIFT app.
* SIM mode is fully implemented (FTMS control point) and physics simulation based on parameters send from ZWIFT and parameters input by the user - see section "launch"
* use virtual gearbox and use Daum buttons and jog wheel to switch gears
* use gpios (see gpio.js) to add hardware switches for more realistic ride and shifting experience, if not, use the jog wheel or +/- buttons on Daum ergobike 8008 TRS

### tested apps
* FULL GAZ - SIM mode working; no rpm
* ZWIFT - ERG mode working; SIM mode working; all signals working

# outlook / features to be developed
* start NodeJS server and raspberry in access point / hotspot mode to connect via mobile device and scan for your local Wi-Fi and enter credentials
* scan for updates via server and select ergoFACE versions, download and reboot
